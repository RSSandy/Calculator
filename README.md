## Reflection

This was a side project I used to practice my skills with Java's math library and JavaFX. I set out to build a basic calculator that was able to perform the functions of your average scientific calculator. 

The project wasn't overwhelmingly hard but did help me practice my skills with basic app setup and frontend development skills. An unexpected obstacle I faced was choosing how to handle user input errors and Java math errors. To avoid dealing with mixed user input, the user can only enter numbers using the boxes in the application and cannot use their keyboard. To handle Java math errors with doubles, I utilized the class BigDecimal.
